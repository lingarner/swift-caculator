# Overview

This is a simple calculator program that can handle friendly user inputs.

The purpose of this software is to help me learn how to understand basic syntaxical function of the programming language: Swift.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
